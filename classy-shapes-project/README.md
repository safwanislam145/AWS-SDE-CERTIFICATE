## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

1.

The Rectangle class represents a rectangular shape; therefore, it will store information such as the length and width of the rectangle.

üñ•Ô∏è TODO 5: Declare two member variables of double type:

length: Stores the length of the rectangle.

width: Stores the width of the rectangle.

2. ADD constructors

Remember, constructors help you to initialize the state of your objects, therefore you will define two constructors for creating the Rectangle objects.

üñ•Ô∏è TODO 6: 

Firstly, a No-argument constructor that enables you to create a rectangle object without specifying an initial value for its properties. You can assign default values (for example, 1.0), within the constructor if needed.

Secondly, a Parameterized constructor that helps you have control over the initial state of your objects. You can ensure that rectangles have valid dimensions when they are created. Place this one after your No-argument constructor.
