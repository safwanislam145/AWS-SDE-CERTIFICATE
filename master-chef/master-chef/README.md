## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).



Challenge 1: The master measurer

Imagine you have a delicious recipe, but you need to serve more guests than originally planned. Create a method called calculateIngredientQuantity to save the day. This method takes two arguments as follows:

servings: An integer that represents the desired number of servings you need to adjust the recipe for. For example, if your recipe originally served 2 people and now you need to feed 4, the value of servings is 4.

originalQuantity: A double representing the amount of a specific ingredient required for a single serving according to the original recipe. It can be a decimal value to represent precise measurements.

The method should return a double value representing the adjusted ingredient quantity based on the desired number of servings.



Challenge 2: The flavor enhancer

Create a method named spiceUpDish that takes one argument as follows:

spiceLevel: An integer that represents the desired level of spiciness. Its value can range from 1 (mild) to 5 (very spicy).

The method should print a message on the screen suggesting spices based on the spice level.

Note: the method does not return anything.

Update the following code block with your own code, and click Run to view the results.



Challenge 3: The greeting guru

Create a method called greetGuest that takes two arguments as follows:

name: A String representing the guest’s name.

timeOfDay: A String representing the time of the day, for example, “morning”, “afternoon”, or “evening”.

The method should print a personalized greeting on the screen based on the time of the day that is passed as the second argument while calling the method.

Note: the method does not return anything.

Tip: You can use an if statement to check the value of the second argument.
